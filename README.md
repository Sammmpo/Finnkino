App requesting data from Finnkino servers.

1. The user selects a theater or area from a list.
2. App displays today's shows, movie icon and theatre with time schedule.

- User can also use search bar to filter out shows they don't want to see

Known bugs

- During Tuesdays (missing confirmation), Finnkino changes images for their events. During this time if there are missing image tags in their XML API the app may not function properly. In this case, the app displays same-sized image with text "No Image".
- If the user changes their Area selection rapidly without letting the fade in animation play over, the application displays shows from both areas regardless of what was the most recent selection.
